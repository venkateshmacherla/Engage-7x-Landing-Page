Engage 7x Academy (Landing Page) (https://engage7x.com/academy/) 
I designed and developed the landing page for the Engage 7x Academy, a professional development platform. 
This landing page provides students with detailed information about the academy and its offerings. It allows 
students to explore and purchase various courses, learn about each course through informative videos, and earn 
certificates upon completion. The design ensures a seamless user experience, enabling students to easily 
navigate the platform and engage with the content effectively. 
Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, WordPress
